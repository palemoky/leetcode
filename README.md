## Essential Algorithm Fundamentals

### Algorithm Basics You Must Master:

1. Linked List: traversal, reversal, merging, cycle detection
2. Binary Tree: level order, preorder/inorder/postorder traversal (both recursive and iterative), inversion
3. Sorting: quick sort, merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, heap sort
4. Binary Search: on sorted arrays, binary trees
5. Bit Manipulation Techniques:
   - XOR (`^`): find numbers that appear only once or twice.
   - AND (&):
     - `n & (n-1)`: removes the lowest set bit, commonly used to check if a number is a power of 2.
     - `n & -n`: gets the lowest set bit.
   - `<<` and `>>`: efficient multiplication and division by 2.
   - Use XOR to find the unique unpaired number.
6. Math Techniques: fast exponentiation, [GCD/LCM](core/math/GCD&LCM/README.md), [elementary math simulation](core/patterns/elementary_math_simulation/README.md)

### Core Algorithm Ideas:

1. Hash table: trading space for time
2. Two pointers: fast/slow pointers, left/right pointers (collision pointers), sliding window
3. DFS: using a stack
4. BFS/backtracking: using a queue
5. Dynamic Programming (DP)
